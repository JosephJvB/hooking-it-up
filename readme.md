# hooks
I need to explore the cool things that people are getting excited about.

### goals
- use one of all the hooks (does that sentence even make sense? Find out later)
- try fancy other tools also:
  - I was gonna use fastify as a server framework, but I set out to learn hooks so I can do that afterwards if I want
  - server caching is cool
  - preact is cool too: but i dont know if it has hooks yet

I wanna use Firebase auth: https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web  
But also I dont because I have written my own auth service before with express!!  
Maybe this is an after-I-do-hooks kinda thing.

```
```js
const fbApp = require('firebase/app')
const fbAuth = require('firebase/auth')
```
