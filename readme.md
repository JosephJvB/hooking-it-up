# New Readme who dis?

### I am using hooks and they are cool.
### Now Im gonna use this as a sandbox to try anything else I think is interesting/worth learning.

- [x] generate svgs. (suggested by Henrik)
  - done in a very basic way. Seems a good start though
  - Cooler: can I get the svg to move across the screen rather than disappear and reappear.
- Get SSL certificate for site: Im getting messages on my input fields that the site is insecure.
- Use PM2 better
- I should make custom popups for error/success of API calls
  - position absolute type stuff
